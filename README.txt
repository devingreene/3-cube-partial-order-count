Consider the set of cube-shaped directed graphs, with nodes at the vertices and arrows at the edges.  We say that such graphs are isomorphic if one can be transformed to the other via a cube isometry (cite?).  To output a complete list of such directed graphs, with only one member from each isomorphism equivalence class, enter the following command in a shell.  (Note, '$' is the shell prompt.)

$ ./printAllIsoPoz3

To restrict the list to those graphs which satisfy the condition described in (cite?), enter the following

$ ./printAllIsoPozDyck3

Please read the comments in main.c for an explanation of the encoding of these graphs.
